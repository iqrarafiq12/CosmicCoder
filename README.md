> WEB AND DESIGN DEVELOPMENT
<br>
I recently added new web development projects to our repository, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These technologies form the backbone of our creations, providing structure, style, and interactivity. The repository now stands as a showcase of our team's proficiency and commitment to pushing the boundaries of web development.
